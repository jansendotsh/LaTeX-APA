    abstract = { Study 1 investigated the effect of mortality salience on support for martyrdom attacks among Iranian college students. Participants were randomly assigned to answer questions about either their own death or an aversive topic unrelated to death and then evaluated materials from fellow students who either supported or opposed martyrdom attacks against the United States. Whereas control participants preferred the student who opposed martyrdom, participants reminded of death preferred the student who supported martyrdom and indicated they were more likely to consider such activities themselves. Study 2 investigated the effect of mortality salience on American college students' support for extreme military interventions by American forces that could kill thousands of civilians. Mortality salience increased support for such measures among politically conservative but not politically liberal students. The roles of existential fear, cultural worldviews, and construing one's nation as pursing a heroic battle against evil in advocacy of violence were discussed. }

The authors compare the relative validities of these two framings using a sample of Lebanese students from the American University of Beirut.

title = {Recommended Practice for Patch Management of Control Systems},
author = {Steven Tom and Dale Christiansen and Dan Berrett},
abstractNote = {A key component in protecting a nation’s critical infrastructure and key resources is the security of control systems. The term industrial control system refers to supervisory control and data acquisition, process control, distributed control, and any other systems that control, monitor, and manage the nation’s critical infrastructure. Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources (CIKR) consists of electric power generators, transmission systems, transportation systems, dam and water systems, communication systems, chemical and petroleum systems, and other critical systems that cannot tolerate sudden interruptions in service. Simply stated, a control system gathers information and then performs a function based on its established parameters and the information it receives. The patch management of industrial control systems software used in CIKR is inconsistent at best and nonexistent at worst. Patches are important to resolve security vulnerabilities and functional issues. This report recommends patch management practices for consideration and deployment by industrial control systems owners.},

abstract = "It is widely acknowledged that employees of an organization are often a weak link in the protection of its information assets. Information security has not been given enough attention in the literature in terms of the human factor effect; researchers have called for more examination in this area. Human factors play a significant role in computer security. In this paper, we focus on the relationship of the human factor on information security presenting the human weaknesses that may lead to unintentional harm to the organization and discuss how information security awareness can be a major tool in overcoming these weaknesses. A framework for a field research is also presented in order to identify the human factors and the major attacks that threat computer security."
